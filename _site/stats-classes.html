<h1>Statistics and Quantitative Classes for Davis GGE</h1>
<p>The UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology requires two courses in quantitative methods. Since the group is so diverse, and such courses are taught by many departments at the University, I thought it would be helpful to collect information</p>
<p>Please add your two cents about this course in the <a href="#disqus_thread">comments</a>!</p>
