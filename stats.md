title: "Statistics and Quantitative Classes for Davis GGE"
---

The UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology requires two courses in quantitative methods.  Since the group is so diverse, and such courses are taught by many departments at the University, I thought it would be helpful to collect information 

Please add your two cents about the courses you took in the comments for each
